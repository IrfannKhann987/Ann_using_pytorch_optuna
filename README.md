# Ann_using_pytorch_optuna
Fashion-MNIST Classification with ANN + Optuna (PyTorch)

This project explores training a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on the Fashion-MNIST dataset
 using PyTorch.
I also used Optuna to fine-tune hyperparameters (learning rate, hidden units, activation functions, etc.) and improve performance beyond the baseline model.

üìå Project Highlights

Implemented a fully-connected ANN from scratch in PyTorch

Trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset (60k training, 10k test images)

Used Optuna for automated hyperparameter optimization

Compared baseline results vs. tuned results

Learned how tuning drastically impacts model performance
